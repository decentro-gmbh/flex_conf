# flex_conf

Flexible configuration file management.

Based on the [nconf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nconf) package, the flex_conf package provides tag-based, hierarchical configuration file loading with atomic object merging. It is possible to register one or more "tags" e.g., `env` for environment-specific configuration files. These tags can then be used inside the configuration file's filename and/ or in folder names to conditionally load the configuration file.

## Installation

Installation is straight forward with npm:
```
npm install flex_conf
```
